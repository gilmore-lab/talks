# Barriers to Open Sharing

--

## Ownership

--
### It's a tough world: "why should I give it away?"
### They're my data. I want exclusive rights to mine them.
### Personal commitments or exclusive agreement with X

# Barriers to Open Sharing

## Credit

--

### Will my dean give me credit for sharing in my promotion evaluation?
### What if someone scoops me?

--
## Blame

### What if someone finds out I made a mistake or was wrong?

---

# Barriers to Open Sharing

## Time
### My file structure is clear to me, but I don't have time to organize it for someone else.
### My files are a mess, and I don't have time to fix it.

--
## Money
### I need every penny I can scrape together to keep my research going
